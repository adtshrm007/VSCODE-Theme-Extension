## 🎯 Goals & Motivation

* Improve code readability across multiple programming languages
* Reduce eye strain during extended development sessions
* Apply accessibility-focused color contrast principles
* Learn the end-to-end process of building, publishing, and maintaining a VS Code extension

---

## 🎨 Theme Design Philosophy

The theme is designed with the following principles in mind:

* **Balanced contrast:** Avoids extreme brightness or dullness
* **Clear syntax separation:** Distinct colors for keywords, variables, strings, functions, and comments
* **Minimal visual noise:** Clean backgrounds and consistent color usage
* **Accessibility-aware choices:** Follows recommended contrast ratios where applicable

The result is a theme that is comfortable for both beginners and experienced developers.

## 🧩 Features

* ✔ Custom syntax highlighting for multiple languages
* ✔ Optimized contrast for dark-mode environments
* ✔ Reduced glare and eye fatigue
* ✔ Clean and consistent UI color palette
* ✔ Lightweight and fast (no runtime overhead)

## 🧑‍💻 Language Support

The theme provides customized syntax highlighting for:

* JavaScript / TypeScript
* React (JSX / TSX)
* HTML & CSS
* JSON
* Python
* Java
* C / C++

Token color rules are carefully tuned to ensure clarity across different language grammars.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Extension Structure

* Built using VS Code’s **theme extension API**
* Uses JSON-based theme configuration
* Token scopes mapped to syntax elements

Example configuration areas:

* Editor background & foreground
* Syntax tokens (keywords, strings, comments)
* UI elements (tabs, sidebar, status bar)

---

## 🚀 Publishing & Deployment

* Packaged and published using `vsce`
* Deployed to the **Visual Studio Code Marketplace**
* Versioned using **Git** and semantic versioning
* Supports future updates and improvements

This demonstrates experience with **real-world extension lifecycle management**.

---

## 🔄 Maintenance & Updates

* Bug fixes and refinements based on usage feedback
* Incremental improvements to color contrast
* Support for additional languages and UI components
